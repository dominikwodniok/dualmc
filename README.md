# Introduction
This project provides a simple C++ implementation of the dual marching cubes
algorithm described in the paper
[Dual Marching Cubes](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1034484)
from Gregory M. Nielson.
It is a byproduct of some work I did as a student assistent back in 2009.
Though there are other implementations out there it might still be helpfull
to someone.

Unfortunately, under rare circumstances the original algorithm can create
non-manifold meshes. See the remarks of the original paper on this problem.
In chapter 3.3.5 of his book "Isosurfaces: Geometry, Topology, and Algorithms"
Rephael Wenger proposed the *manifold* dual marching cubes algorithm as a
possible solution, which is also included in this implementation.

# Requirements
* C++11
* No other dependencies

# Implementation
The algorithm is implemented in the files `dualmc.h`, `dualmc.tpp`,
and `dualmc_tables.tpp`. A simple example command-line application which demonstrates
basic usage is provided as well. An application for generating the (manifold)
dual marching cubes tables is implemented in `apps/gentables`.

Dual point computation could be improved using Hermite data or at least first
derivatives as described in [Dual Contouring of Hermite Data](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=566586).
So feel free to contribute :)

# Example Application
To build the example and see the available options in a Linux environment type:

    $ make
    $ ./dmc -help

A basic CMAKE file is provided as well.
If this still does not suit you under Windows or OS X the adept programmer should have no problems
setting up a small project.

## RAW Files
The example application can only read 8-bit and 16-bit volume data sets in the
very limited *RAW* format (i.e. only stores raw data, no further information such
as the volume grid dimension is included).
A classic source for RAW files is http://www.volvis.org/ . Currently, the site
does not seem to be available.
The [OpenQVis](http://openqvis.sourceforge.net/index.html) project also provides some
data sets in RAW format.
Another source is [The Volume Library](http://www9.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/External/vollib/)
from Stefan Roettger. This site provides files in the more versatile *PMV* format
but also code which can convert these files to RAW.

The example application provides a small cube data set (32^3)and can also generate a
caffeine molecule.
To extract a surface from the cube volume type:

    $ ./dmc -raw data/cube.raw 32 32 32 -iso 0.5

The iso value of 0.5 is mapped to a middle density w.r.t. the bit-depth of the data set.
For the caffeine data set type:

    $ ./dmc -caffeine -iso 0.5

![caffeine](example.png "caffeine molecule")

For code simplicity the example outputs surfaces in the
[Wavefront OBJ](http://www.fileformat.info/format/wavefrontobj/egff.htm)
format.

This has been extended by RepRap Ltd (https://reprapltd.com) to allow tensors of floats to be read in as 
the grid defining the iso-surface, and to allow ASCII STL files to be written as well.

The tensor file format (.tns , though that extension is not compulsory) is a list of three integers then many floats all separated by spaces:

xDimension yDimension zDimension minValue maxValue { (xDimension &ast; yDimension &ast; zDimension) function values } EoF

The first three integers are the size of the tensor.  The second two floats are the maximum and minimum values of all the numbers in the tensor, then there is a list of the float values incrementing x fastest, then y, then z.

Example command line to read such data and output an STL file.:

$ ./dmc -tensor data/testCylinder.tns -iso 0.5 -out data/testCylinder.stl
